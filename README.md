# Coding-Qualtrics
The purpose of this experiment is to be able to ask questions on a potentially global scale about how programmers learn to code and their coding behaviors. This will be done using a Qualtrics survey containing programming questions, where the programmer will be able to work in an online IDE to answer these questions, and where statistics will be collected including number of edits, compiles, which errors occurred, and how long the task took. The ability to continuously collect large amounts of data on coding behaviors is important for future research and can give insight into questions on how programmers learn to code that have not been able to be asked before.
